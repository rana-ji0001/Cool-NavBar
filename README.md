# Cool-NavBar
Navbar which rolls over elements in 3D way
<br>
This is a modern, horizontal navigation bar featuring interactive icons for Home, 
Contact Us, About, Settings, and Profile. The design incorporates a soft 3D shadow effect to give a sense of depth and elevation.
A unique hover animation is applied using CSS transitions, where a highlight div smoothly rolls across the icons, creating the illusion of movement — almost like it’s gliding over water.
As users hover over each icon, the corresponding label elegantly slides outward, enhancing the user experience with both visual and functional appeal.

Built using HTML and CSS, this navbar is ideal for sleek, responsive websites looking for a touch of creative flair and modern design interactivity.
